    * Version 1.3, Unicode 11.0, French version 1.2 is at Unicode 10.0.
    * Library internal definitions personalized to allow more than one
      library to be loaded at a time. Base library maintains same names
      for backwards compatibility with older programs.
    * Optional python wrapper available for directly accessing library.
      Use python's pip to install wrapper (requires pip and wheel).

- 2018-Apr-08
    * Unicode 11.0_Beta (Nameslist.txt 11_Beta for review until Apr23).
    * Added Python wrapper and names2 functions.

- 2017-Aug-07
    * Version 1.2, Unicode 10.0, French version is now also 10.0.0.
    * Added function calls to French version to allow use of one or more
      libraries at the same (Dynamic library linking needs testing since
      added 'FR' may be issue with older programs expecting same name).
    * Added more "make check" to include checking French library.

- 2017-Jul-01
    * Version 1.1, Unicode 10.0, French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).

- 2016-Jul-01
    * Version 1.0, Unicode 9.0, French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).
    * Corrected library to report correctly as next version up. This is
      probably a significant change, therefore bumped both libraries to
      start at 1.0 even though backwards compatibility remains the same,
      otherwise would have become version_0.6 (and French version_0.4).
    * Removed the excessively long package name, which you'll note as a
      so-bump change with Fedora and also Debian in naming this package.

- 2015-Jul-01

    * Added function for block {start, end, name, number} for version 0.4.
    * Cleaned up several warnings for program buildnameslist.

- 2013-May-01
    * Makefile.am problems in changing nameslist.h to uninameslist.h, and
      nameslist-fr.h to uninameslist-fr.h, therefore renamed those files.
    * Removed several files that can be built during autoreconf and automake
      steps to building a tar.gz package.
    * Added additional check for -enable-oldfrenchlib to "make distcheck"
    * This will be tagged as version 0.3

- 2013-Apr-28
    * Separate namelist.h and namelist-fr.h due to different versions.
    * Clarify README to indicated differences between both libraries.
